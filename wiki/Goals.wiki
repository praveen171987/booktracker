This is my list of objectives, hopefully it won't grow too much faster than they're crossed off.  Feel free to add your own.

= Details =

==Short Term (this month)==
  * Add periodic polling for status updates from library
  * XSLT to map google book data to custom format as item details (short click on item) (means it's only available when user is online, is that an issue?)

  * Make list filterable by status and/or by text

==Medium Term (next month)==
  * Refactor to Fragments for Android 3.0
  * Create a Settings page for easy customization
  * Clean up error handling (network unavailable)
  * Set up a web presence for advertising/support/feedback
  * Register as an Android Dev
  * Further library integration (making and tracking reservations)

==Long Term (next 3 months)==
  * Publish to Market
  * User survey (esp. Beta) via google docs and in-app link
