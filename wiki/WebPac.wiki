The catalog url should be of the form
{{{
http://libsys.arlingtonva.us/search/?searchtype=i&searcharg=%s&searchscope=1
}}}
where `searchtype=i` indicates an ISBN search, `searcharg=%s` is where the ISBN number will go and `searchscope` indicates the position of the target branch in the user interface's dropdown list.  In general `searchscope` is the only element that should vary, and it should probably be set to the 'main' branch unless the user wants a very narrow search.
